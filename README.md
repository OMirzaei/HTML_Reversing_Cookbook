# HTML_Reversing_Cookbook
A repository of CyberChef recipes for reversing HTML files

Welcome to the HTML Reversing Cookbook! This repository is a collection of CyberChef recipes for decoding and decrypting strings in HTML attachments. Whether you're a security professional, a developer, or just curious about reverse engineering, you'll find a variety of useful modules here.

[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is a powerful open-source web application developed by the [Government Communications Headquarters](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/) that facilitates the decoding and decryption of JavaScript code in HTML attachments. It provides a variety of modules (or functions) for decoding and decryption that can be combined to build a "recipe." These recipes can then be exported in different formats and loaded later for use elsewhere.
